# Purr-spective
My 2024-2025, senior project

Welcome to Purr-Spective, an immersive adventure that blends fun, learning, and humor in a vibrant medieval city. Step into a world alive with quirky characters, intriguing quests, and rich stories waiting to be uncovered. Your mission? Earn enough gold to help the eccentric narrator unlock the fascinating life and works of Van Gogh. Explore, laugh, and learn as you navigate this unique journey in my first game, crafted as part of my senior project. Are you ready to see the world through a whole new purr-spective?

Mention: There is no save button. Have fun!
